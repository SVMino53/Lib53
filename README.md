# Lib53
## Created by Isak "Mino53" Forsberg

This is a static library I am creating to use for my other projects. It will contain useful classes, structs, constants and functions to help with advanced math.

The library is currently in a very early state and not useful yet. Once it is useful, this document will be updated.

***Progress:*** *WIP*  
***Version:*** *0.0*
